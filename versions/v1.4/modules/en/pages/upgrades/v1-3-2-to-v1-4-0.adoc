= Upgrade from v1.3.2 to v1.4.0

== General Information

An *Upgrade* button appears on the *Dashboard* screen whenever a new Harvester version that you can upgrade to becomes available. For more information, see xref:./upgrades.adoc#start-an-upgrade[Start an upgrade].

For air-gapped environments, see xref:./upgrades.adoc#prepare-an-air-gapped-upgrade[Prepare an air-gapped upgrade].

== Known Issues

=== 1. The upgrade process becomes stuck in the "Pre-draining" state.

A virtual machine with a container disk cannot be migrated because of a limitation of the live migration feature. This causes the upgrade process to become stuck in the "Pre-draining" state.

[TIP]
====
Manually stop the virtual machines to continue the upgrade process.
