= Air-Gapped Environment

This section describes how to use {harvester-product-name} in an air gapped environment. Some use cases could be where {harvester-product-name} will be installed offline, behind a firewall, or behind a proxy.

The ISO image contains all the packages to make it work in an air gapped environment.

== Working Behind an HTTP Proxy

In some environments, the connection to external services, from the servers or VMs, requires an HTTP(S) proxy.

=== Configure an HTTP Proxy During Installation

You can configure the HTTP(S) proxy during the xref:../installation-setup/methods/iso-install.adoc[ISO installation] as shown in picture below:

image::install/iso-proxy.png[iso-proxy]

=== Configure an HTTP Proxy

You can configure the HTTP(S) proxy using the UI.

. Go to the settings page of the UI.
. Find the `http-proxy` setting, click *â‹® > Edit setting*
. Enter the value(s) for `http-proxy`, `https-proxy` and `no-proxy`.

[NOTE]
====
{harvester-product-name} appends necessary addresses to user configured `no-proxy` to ensure the internal traffic works.
i.e., `localhost,127.0.0.1,0.0.0.0,10.0.0.0/8,longhorn-system,cattle-system,cattle-system.svc,harvester-system,.svc,.cluster.local`. `harvester-system` was added into the list since v1.1.2.

When the nodes in the cluster do not use a proxy to communicate with each other, the CIDR needs to be added to `http-proxy.noProxy` after the first node is installed successfully. Please refer to xref:../troubleshooting/cluster.adoc#_fail_to_deploy_a_multi_node_cluster_due_to_incorrect_http_proxy_setting[fail to deploy a multi-node cluster].

== Guest Cluster Images

All necessary images to install and run {harvester-product-name} are conveniently packaged into the ISO, eliminating the need to pre-load images on bare-metal nodes. A {harvester-product-name} cluster manages them independently and effectively behind the scenes.

However, it's essential to understand a guest K8s cluster (e.g., RKE2 cluster) created by the xref:../integrations/rancher/node-driver/node-driver.adoc[Harvester node driver] is a distinct entity from a {harvester-product-name} cluster. A guest cluster operates within VMs and requires pulling images either from the internet or a https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/global-default-private-registry#configure-a-private-registry-with-credentials-when-creating-a-cluster[private registry].

If the *Cloud Provider* option is configured to {harvester-product-name} in a guest Kubernetes cluster, it deploys the Harvester cloud provider and Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver.

As a result, we recommend monitoring each https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases[RKE2 release] in your air gapped environment and pulling the required images into your private registry. Please refer to the https://www.suse.com/suse-harvester/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/harvester-v1-1-2/[Support Matrix page] for the best Harvester cloud provider and CSI driver capability support.

== Known Issues

=== 1. Missing `rancher/rancher-agent:v2.9.2` image affects deployment in air-gapped environments. (Issue https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/7157[#7157])

Rancher v2.9.2, which is embedded in Harvester v1.4.0, introduced a new cronjob (https://github.com/rancher/rancher/commit/53ba791e11f98a5594c6fa8a30d321602483446c[`rke2-machine-config-cleanup`]). This cronjob uses a container image (`rancher/rancher-agent:v2.9.2`) that is not included in the Harvester v1.4.0 ISO. To mitigate the issue, you can pull the image from the internet and then load it in the air-gapped environment.

[,bash]
----
# on a computer which can reach the internet and harvester cluster
docker pull rancher/rancher-agent:v2.9.2
docker save rancher/rancher-agent:v2.9.2 -o rancher-agent-v2.9.2.tar

# copy rancher-agent-v2.9.2.tar to the air-gapped environment
scp rancher-agent-v2.9.2.tar rancher@<harvester-node-ip>:/tmp

# ssh to the harvester node and load the image
ssh rancher@<harvester-node-ip>
sudo -i
docker load -i /tmp/rancher-agent-v2.9.2.tar
